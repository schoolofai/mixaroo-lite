## Team Data Integrity (Mandatory)
- Load and follow `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/skills/json-guardian/SKILL.md` whenever you touch `.team` files.
- Before reporting completion or handoff, run: `octeams validate-team --json`.
- If validation fails, fix every reported file/line and re-run until `ok=true`.
- Do not append JSONL manually with `echo`/`cat >>`; use `octeams` commands for writes.
