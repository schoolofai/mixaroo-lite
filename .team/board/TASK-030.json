Findings:\n\nBUG (HIGH): 44 test files leak into npm tarball. tsc compiles __tests__ into dist/ and package.json files:[\"dist\"] includes everything. Fix: either exclude tests in tsconfig (separate tsconfig.build.json) or add .npmignore with dist/**/__tests__/.\n\nPASS: package.json has correct bin, files, engines, type, prepublishOnly fields.\nPASS: dist/cli.js has shebang line.\nPASS: CLI --version, --help, all subcommands work from built dist.\nPASS: Global install via npm install -g works, mx-lite binary resolves correctly.\nPASS: README included in tarball.",
