  "description": "src/commands/__tests__/error-edge.test.ts expects '--save' in CLI help output but the flag isn't registered on the main generate command in src/cli.ts. Either add the -s/--save option to the program argument definition in cli.ts, or fix the test assertion to match actual behavior. The --save flag should be visible in help output since it's a user-facing feature.",
