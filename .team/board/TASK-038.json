  "description": "QA found 7 inaccuracies: (1) README references nonexistent 'config get' subcommand, (2) default length says 25 but actual is 30, (3) config path says ~/.config/mixaroo-lite/ but actual is mixaroo-lite-nodejs/, (4) PUBLISHING.md file counts/sizes wrong, (5) blog says ~500 lines but source is ~1668, (6) blog roadmap lists save/load as future but it's shipped, (7) CHANGELOG date 2026-02-20 needs confirmation. Verify each by running CLI commands, then fix all docs.",
