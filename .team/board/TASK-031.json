Only show/set/reset/path exist.\n\nBUG-2 (MEDIUM): README says default playlist length is 25 but actual default is 30.\n\nBUG-3 (MEDIUM): README says config stored in ~/.config/mixaroo-lite/ but actual path is ~/.config/mixaroo-lite-nodejs/.\n\nBUG-4 (MEDIUM): PUBLISHING.md claims ~30 files, ~17 kB, excluding tests. Actual: 102 files, 40 kB, tests included (related to TASK-033 tarball leak).\n\nBUG-5 (LOW): Blog post says '~500 lines of TypeScript' — actual source is ~1668 lines.\n\nBUG-6 (LOW): Blog post lists 'Save/load' and 'Expand' as future roadmap, but save/list/play are already implemented. Roadmap section is stale.\n\nBUG-7 (INFO): CHANGELOG date says 2026-02-20. Confirm this is the intended release date.\n\nPASS: All CLI commands in README work correctly (setup, config show/set/reset/path, list, play, history, completions bash/zsh/fish).\nPASS: Model names match actual code (gpt-4o-mini, gemini-1.5-flash, claude-3-haiku).\nPASS: --version, --help, --length, --provider, --save, --verbose flags all present.\nPASS: Demo script, recording guide, twitter thread, reddit posts, HN post are internally consistent.",
