You'll be asked to:
1. Choose your AI provider (OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic)
2. Enter your API key

The key is validated before saving. Config is stored in `~/.config/mixaroo-lite/`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"

Your key might be expired or incorrectly entered. Get a new one:

- **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Gemini**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- **Anthropic**: https://console.anthropic.com/

Then run `mx-lite setup` again.

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You've hit your provider's rate limit. Wait a minute and try again, or switch providers.

### "Not configured"

Run `mx-lite setup` to set up your AI provider and API key.

### Some songs not found on YouTube

This happens! The AI might suggest obscure tracks or songs with names that don't match YouTube's index exactly. The playlist will still work with the songs that were found.

### Reset everything

```bash
mx-lite config reset
```

## API Keys

You'll need an API key from one of these providers:

| Provider | Model Used | Get Your Key |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| OpenAI | gpt-4o-mini | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| Google Gemini | gemini-1.5-flash | [makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) |
| Anthropic | claude-3-haiku | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) |

All three use their cheapest/fastest models to keep costs minimal.
